Bombus Apis Bee is a content mod that adds a new class, the Beekeeper! This class utilizes Honey, a custom resource, to use with hymenoptra weapons. Honey is similar to mana, but it has much more scalability. This means that if you run completely out of honey, you will have to wait upwards of 15 seconds to have it regenerate to full, but keeping an eye on the resource and keeping it high, you will be able to regenerate it much quicker. The Beekeeper class has a large focus on homing and strong damage, with the drawbacks being very little defense, usually having as much or less than summoner throughout progression. The mod has a high focus on quality, with the newest update reworking almost every single weapon, armor set, and accessory to be as high quality as possible.

This mod currently has 56 weapons, 7 armor sets, 2 armor helmets that corrospond to vanilla armor sets, and 21 accessories.
