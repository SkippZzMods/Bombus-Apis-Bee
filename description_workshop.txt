Bombus Apis Bee is a content mod that adds a new class, the Beekeeper! This class utilizes Honey, a custom resource, to use with hymenoptra weapons. The Beekeeper class has a large focus on homing and strong damage, with the drawbacks being very little defense, usually having as much or less than summoner throughout progression.

This mod currently has 47 weapons, 6 armor sets, 2 armor helmets that corrospond to vanilla armor sets, and 12 accessories. 

[i]Please note that this mod is [b]NOT[/b] the Calamity Expansion, that mod will be ported at a later date. It will take longer due to the fact that it has more content and code to port[/i]
